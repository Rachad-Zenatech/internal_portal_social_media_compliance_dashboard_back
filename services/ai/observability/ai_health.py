"""Whether the AI (Gemini) is working right now, for the banner every signed-in user sees when it isn't.

Read from the AI calls themselves: each one is traced with whether it worked and, when it didn't, what kind of failure
it was (ai_observability.classify_error). The AI counts as down when the latest call failed and nothing has worked for
a couple of minutes (one model failing and the next one working, as the fallback does all the time, is not "down").
Read from the database, so every server process agrees and a restart doesn't forget.
